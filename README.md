 # Time Progress Bar
 A progress bar plasmoid for your [KDE Plasma desktop](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) (only Plasma 6) showing the progress of time.

 Inspired by the year progress bar, it can show the progress of the year, month, week, day or an interval between two custom date-times.

## Installation
The pager is available on the [KDE store](https://store.kde.org/p/2126775), so you can download and install it directly from Plasma.

 ## TODO
